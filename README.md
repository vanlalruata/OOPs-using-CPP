# OOPs using CPP
 Object Oriented Programmings using C++


## C++ Programming for Undergraduate Students

## Designed by Dr. Vanlalruata Hnamte

Welcome to the C++ Programming Repository, a collection of beginner to advanced C++ programs tailored for undergraduate students. These programs cover fundamental and advanced concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), templates, STL, encryption, multi-threading, and GUI development with Qt.

# Features & Topics Covered
## Beginner Programs

    + Basic Syntax (Variables, Functions, Scope)
    + Classes & Objects (Encapsulation, Constructors, Destructors)
    + Inheritance & Polymorphism (Overriding, Virtual Functions)
    + Operator Overloading & Friend Functions

## Intermediate Programs

    + Templates & Function Templates
    + STL Containers & Iterators (Vector, List, Map, Stack, Queue)
    + File Handling (Binary & Text Files)
    + Multi-threading with std::thread
    + Memory Management & Smart Pointers

## Advanced Programs

    + Metaprogramming & SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)
    + Move Semantics & Perfect Forwarding
    + RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    + Coroutines (C++20) for Asynchronous Programming
    + Encryption & Cryptography with OpenSSL (AES, RSA)
    + Hardware ID Extraction (CPU ID, BIOS ID)

## Final Project: GUI-Based Serial Key Generator

    + Qt-Based GUI (Qt Widgets)
    + Serial Key Generation (User + Hardware ID)
    + AES-256 Encryption & RSA Signature
    + Serial Key Verification


## Installation & Compilation
Most programs can be compiled using g++ (GCC) or MSVC:

> g++ program.cpp -o program
> ./program

## For Qt-Based GUI Application
Ensure Qt 5 or Qt 6 is installed, then build using:

> qmake SerialKeyGenerator.pro
> make
> ./SerialKeyGenerator

## For OpenSSL-Based Encryption Programs
Ensure OpenSSL is installed:
> g++ encrypt.cpp -o encrypt -lssl -lcrypto
> ./encrypt

## Contribution Guidelines
    + Bug Reports & Issues: If you encounter any errors, please report them in the Discussions.
    + Feature Requests: Have an idea? Feel free to open an issue and suggest improvements.
    + Pull Requests: Contributions are welcome! Ensure code follows modern C++ standards (C++17/20).
